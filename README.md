# StackGAN-BERT: Text-to-Image Generation

This project integrates Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks (StackGAN) with BERT embeddings to generate high-resolution images from textual descriptions. The model is trained using the CUB-200-2011 bird dataset, allowing for the creation of photo-realistic bird images based on user-provided text input. The system features a two-stage GAN architecture, leveraging BERT to capture the nuanced meaning of input text for more accurate image generation.

## Features

- **Text-to-Image Generation:** Generate images from text descriptions.
- **BERT Embeddings:** Utilize BERT for richer text representation.
- **Two-Stage GAN:** High-resolution image refinement through a two-stage process.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and set up the environment.
2. Generate BERT embeddings and train the model.
3. Use the web interface or scripts to generate images from text input.
